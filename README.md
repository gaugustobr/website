This non-profit repository intention is to help the community to learn the DevOps methodology and culture throughout a series of classes and hands-on laboratories based on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and become ready to start working as Automation/Cloud/DevOps Engineer.

Feel free to contribute with content (PR), help peer reviewing code or just going through the exercises!
